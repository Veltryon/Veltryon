## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

This is my profile, where I aim to document journey into coding and scripting, and later, my own, personal projects.

My day job is in the field of cybersecurity, and my interests are in using scripting for Blue Team/Cyber Defense, such as automating common tasks, tool development, security investigations.

I've just started learning python, however, I'm also interested in lrearning other languages like C#, PowerShell (and we should not forget about query languages like KQL, neither).
